 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Submit a job (JCL) contained in a data set. The data set may be of type physical
   sequential or a PDS member. The command does not pre-validate the data set name.
   The command presents errors verbatim from the z/OSMF Jobs REST endpoints. For
   more information about z/OSMF Jobs API errors, see the z/OSMF Jobs API REST
   documentation.

 USAGE
 -----

   bright zos-jobs submit data-set <dataset> [options]

 POSITIONAL OPTIONS
 ------------------

   dataset		 (string)

      The z/OS data set containing the JCL to submit. You can specify a physical
      sequential data set (for example, \\"DATA.SET\\") or a partitioned data set
      qualified by a member (for example, \\"DATA.SET(MEMBER)\\"). The data set must be
      cataloged.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string) (optional)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array) (optional)

      Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property
      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string) (optional)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (flag) (optional)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (flag) (optional)

      Produce the command response as a JSON document

   --help  | -h (flag) (optional)

      Display help text


 EXAMPLES
 --------

   Submit the JCL in the data set \\"ibmuser.cntl(deploy)\\":
