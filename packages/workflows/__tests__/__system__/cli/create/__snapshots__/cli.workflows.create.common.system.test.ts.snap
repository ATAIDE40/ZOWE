   --variables  | --vs (string)

      A list of one or more variables for the workflow.

   --assign-to-owner  | --ao (boolean)

      Indicates whether the workflow steps are assigned to the workflow owner

   --access-type  | --at (string)

      Specifies the access type for the workflow. Public, Restricted or Private.

      Allowed values: Public, Restricted, Private

   --delete-completed  | --dc (boolean)

      Whether the successfully completed jobs to be deleted from the JES spool.

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property
      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text


 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Create a workflow with name \\"testworkflow\\" data set
   \\"TESTID.WKFLOW\\", system name \\"TESTM1\\" and owner \\"testid\\":
